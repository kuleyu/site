## Drip-Drip Your Cart Recovery Email Campaign

<br>

Sometimes, one cart recovery email isn’t enough. And as for sending the second one, store owners find it hard to do it manually. Which is why, Retainful comes with features to create drip/sequential cart recovery emails. Recover carts while you sleep. Here’s a recommended email sequence that works.

<br>


-   The 1st cart recovery email goes 1 hour after your visitor abandons his/her cart.
    
-   The 2nd one exactly 6 hours after the cart abandonment.
    
-   The 3rd cart recovery email, 1 day after the cart has been abandoned.
    
-   Send the 4th reminder 3 days after cart abandonment.
    
-   The final reminder can go 5 days after cart abandonment.
    

Most of the abandoned checkouts are recovered somewhere between the 3rd and the 4th email!
