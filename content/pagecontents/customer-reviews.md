This product has worked great for our business and has allowed us to convert customers that we most likely would not have. It's very easy to set up and the plugin provides tremendous support if needed.

This plugin works as intended, Great.   
Got the paid version.   I had a conflict with my theme, and the support was super helpful with me fixing it and very kind.  **I recommend it highly.**

#### Excellent plugin, couldn't live without it
Excellent plugin for WordPress! Well-deserved 5 Star rating! The plugin has all of the features needed to recover abandoned carts, with lots of options for customisation - without having to edit PHP files directly. I've already recovered carts that led to a jump in my online sales. Great customer support too! Will definitely recommend!

#### Best abandoned carts plugin ever!
Finally, I found the plugin that works! It's not the only plugin working great, but their support is amazing! In their dashboard, they have a chat window with real people replying to you, and they walked me through every single step and stayed with me for hours to explain everything, although I haven't purchased a premium version yet. I highly recommend them, love their work so much so I wasn't even lazy to come here and write a review about them!

#### Excellent Plugin! Excellent Support!
Great plugin! Worth the $9/month we pay. Great features...              

LIKES:              
✅ Add coupon to all order receipts with a "next order" discount coupon         
✅ Add-to-cart popup to capture info right at the right time        
✅ Exit-intent popup to capture "leavers"      
✅ Emojis work in all the fields        
✅ AWESOME SUPPORT! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ We needed a custom feature and they coded it for us and walked us through how to implement it. 

If you have some basic HTML knowledge, you can really kick it up a level, especially on the Exit-intent popup where you have direct access to the source code. 

Also, you can run the email and database management of the plugin in the cloud, which is included in the price - nice perk! 

Great job guys!

#### Works like a charm. Perfect for WooCommerce stores.
Retainful is easy to use with a useful UI. Provides a lot of functionality even with the free tier. "Next Order coupon" is a simple and good way to increase the conversions and bring back your customers
