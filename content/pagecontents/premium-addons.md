## Add-to-Cart Email Capture Popups

<br>

Capture the customer's email before the checkout. You can trigger a popup to capture a customer's email when he adds an item to the cart. Since most visitors tend to abandon their shopping carts before reaching the checkout step, this feature allows you to collect email and send a reminder, if customers abandon the cart. Also, you can encourage customers to provide their email by offering them a discount. 

<br>

-   Popup is fully customizable to fit your branding and GDPR compliant.
    
-   Automatically trigger popup when visitors click "add to cart button".
    
-   Offer a coupon to motivate the customers to enter their email.

## Countdown Timers to Create Urgency

<br>

-   Display Sales Countdown Timer with custom messages & auto apply coupon codes.
    
-   Customize coupon codes with messages and expiry dates.
    
-   Decide where to display the countdown timer on your store - could be above the cart or below the coupon & more.
