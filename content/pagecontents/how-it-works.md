## Configure Cart Recovery Emails

## Start Recovering Abandoned Carts

As soon as a cart gets abandoned on your store, Retainful sends its first email (based on the trigger time you’ve set). And then followed by a series of emails which lures the visitors to buy what they’ve left behind. Carts get recovered and your revenue increases. It’s easier than said.
