### Track Abandoned Carts

<br>

To capture abandoned carts, you need to be able to track them first. And Retainful helps you do just that. Know what's happening with the shopping carts on your store in one single dashboard.

<br>

-   Check abandoned carts in your store in real-time
    
-   Find out items left out by the customers in those abandoned carts.
    
-   See how much revenue you have recovered from your otherwise lost sales. Also see your cart abandonment rate and value.
    
-   Track carts that only matter by using Retainful IP Filtering option. Exclude a single IP, multiple IP's or even a range of IPs
    
-   Know when exactly the carts have been abandoned along with the respective visitor's email address.

### Automated Cart Recovery Email Campaigns

-   Create a series of emails at perfect intervals. You can send unlimited emails
    
-   Powerful drag and drop email editor to create beautiful emails in minutes.
    
-   Use our existing collection of emails or create your own emails using the drag and drop email builder.
    
-   Personalize cart recovery emails by using shortcodes to add customer names along with items they've abandoned.
    
-   Send cart recovery emails at regular intervals. The first email can be sent after an hour, the second after 6 hours. It's totally up to you.
    
-   Include a unique recovery link for single-click recovery of carts automatically
    
-   Send a coupon code to motivate customers to come back and complete their purchase.
