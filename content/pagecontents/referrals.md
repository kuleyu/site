### Your customer refers a friend

Each customer in your store gets a unique link with a referral code. The customer invites
their friends using the link or the referral code to your store.

### Friend makes a purchase

The friend (referred person) visits your store using the unique link, enters his email to
get his discount code. And then makes a successful purchase.

### Earn New Customers through Word-of-Mouth

<br>


Acquiring customers is costly and hard. But a Word-of-Mouth sale is 10x cheaper and has a higher
conversion rate. People usually trust recommendations from people they know. Your customers have an
immediate network that is full of people just like them, and those are the people who will buy and buy
again.

### Drive Repeat Sales

<br>

The best way to get repeat sales is to get more of the right customers, and the best way to get more of
the right customers is to deliberately leverage the network of the customers you already have. A
Referral program can help you turn your existing customers as your brand ambassadors and get more new
customers for you.
