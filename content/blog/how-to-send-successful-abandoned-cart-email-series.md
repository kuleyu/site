### Writing successful Abandoned Cart Emails

While you send a series of Shopify abandoned cart emails, consider the following aspects.

-   Email content
    
-   The time gap between one email and the next
    
-   Total number of abandoned cart emails
    
-   The product image or video if any
    
-   Exact product info
    
-   Adding details about the product demand

-   Current offers available for the product
    
-   Offers available for the next purchase
    
### Email Content

"Content is the king."

No matter what exciting offers you provide. No matter what strategy you use for marketing. One bad abandoned cart email can ruin everything. So do pay attention to what you write in your cart recovery email for Shopify.

### Subject

<br>

The most important part of an abandoned cart email is the subject line. <link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/blog/13-best-subject-lines-for-abandoned-cart-email-campaigns" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A catchy subject line</link-text> increases the probability of it getting clicked and opened.

### Body

Convey everything that you want with the best Shopify cart recovery email template. Concentrate on the placement and the number of occurrences of Call-To-Action(CTA). Do not provide too much as well as too few CTAs. Keep the content crisp yet informative and stick to an abandoned cart email design that attracts.

### Single Click buttons

Make sure you provide single-click buttons in the email that link to the abandoned cart, landing page, website or a video in your Shopify store. Furthermore, always provide CTA as a bold single click option.

**Reminder**

If that works out, there is no need for further abandoned cart emails, as reminder emails are programmed to stop immediately once the customer converts. You can also track the performances of simple reminder emails over other addons and strategies used for cart recovery.
