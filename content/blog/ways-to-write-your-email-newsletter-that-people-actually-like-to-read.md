Don’t try to promote your products in newsletters, instead try sharing some valuable, educational information to your subscribers that’s what professional newsletters are meant for.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/ways-to-write-your-email-newsletter-that-people-actually-like-to-read/4-less-promotional.png)

Always remember the classic ratio of 90/10%. Yes, your newsletters should have only a 10% promotion and 90% of resourceful information.

If they feel you are pushing your promotions against them they are likely to unsubscribe.

The goal of newsletters is to engage with subscribers not to chase them away. Unless you have a crucial announcement about your business or product, stay away from promotions.

### Draft a visually pleasing content

Drafting attractive yet visually pleasing content is one of the best newsletter practices. Because newsletters are sent directly to readers via email so only an engaging content will boost conversions.

A notable tip to make your content visually pleasing is adding an image. A well-designed newsletter should have a balanced text and images.

Readers will be attracted to images as soon as they open it and also get engaged with your text at the same time. But always remember not to overdo it, keep it simple and elegant.

### Make your newsletter personalized

The best newsletter practice is to mention your reader’s name in the subject or in the content to make it look personalized and boost click-through rates exponentially.

If you notice, most subject lines of professional newsletters aren’t personalized. But if you add a name in your subject line it conveys a couple of things,

1.  It says the newsletter is for a specific customer.
    
2.  It shows that the company cares for the reader.
    
Customers will be motivated to read it when the newsletter is personalized for them. Around 26% of emails were opened when it has a personalized subject line.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/ways-to-write-your-email-newsletter-that-people-actually-like-to-read/6-personalized.png)

It is a well-known fact that personalization leads to huge wins as long as email marketing is concerned. This strategy will help you build better engagement with your customers.

### Create concise and snappy content

People don’t like to sit around and read a long boring paragraph, they want facts. If you want people to read your newsletters you have to be precise with your content.

Marketing experts have pointed out that newsletters should range between 200 to 500 words. Snappy content leads to happy readers.

Put yourself in the shoes of your readers, and think realistically how much time you have in a day to check your emails. When you figure it out you’ll know how much information you can share with your reader.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/ways-to-write-your-email-newsletter-that-people-actually-like-to-read/7-snappy-content.png)

**Here are few tips for creating concise content,**

-   Perceive what your readers want and then start writing the content.
    
-   Don’t start your content with the goal of 200 words, you’ll end up missing out too much.
    
-   Write your content as you always do, then cut it out to make it snappy.
    
-   You can always send professional newsletters in two parts if your content is long.
    
If you draft a long monotonous content, your newsletter is more likely to end up as spam. The main motive of the newsletter is to increase conversion rates so keep your content snappy.

Provide your audience only with the best information thus saving their time which boosts your credibility and trust.

### Provide necessary call-to-action

**Why do you invest your time and effort in sending newsletters?**

You can add necessary CTAs to encourage your reader to perform an action. You can use multiple CTAs as you wish based on your requirements.

-   Remember to keep it short.
    
-   Create a sense of urgency.

### Keep it consistent

Let your customers know that you care for them and their opinions by having a consistent connection with them through newsletters

Reading your newsletter should be a priority to your customers, not a choice of ‘I may read it or I maynot’. So always remember to be consistent with your newsletter schedule.

### Make it simple to unsubscribe

Having an unsubscription button seems like a bad idea, but it is essential. Stay true to your readers, if they are uncomfortable with your service, make it easier for them to unsubscribe.
