Remember, a business page is not similar to a personal profile. A business page has an ecosystem of features like post scheduling, advertising, and analytics which can help your marketing campaign.

## Why do you need a Facebook business page?

<br>

When you own a Shopify store or a product like <link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/abandoned-cart-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abandoned cart recovery</link-text>, you need to constantly experiment with every possible way to <link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/blog/50-proven-ways-to-promote-your-shopify-stor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promote your Shopify store.</link-text> And that is exactly why you should set up a Facebook business page for your Shopiy store; to increase your brand awareness, drive conversions, and achieve more sales.

-   Share influential posts about your brand.
    
-   Showcase your customer reviews and establish trust.
    
-   Interact with your customers.
    
-   Share your success stories, fosters a personal touch.
    
-   Share updates and news about your products.
    

## Does it cost to create a Business page?

Just like other features of Facebook, like personal profiles and groups, creating and managing a business page is free.

Why doesn’t Facebook charge you? Because you are already bringing more traffic to Facebook through your followers, that’s why.

But there is a paid feature on Facebook, ads. Even though ads are unrelated to the business page you can still make use of the feature to reach more audiences.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/how-to-build-a-killer-facebook-business-page-for-your-shopify-store/3-ad-cost.png)

<br>

Ads are optional, it solely depends on you to use it, but it does provide a huge opportunity to expand your audience and take your business to all corners of the world.

## Is it safe using a personal profile for Business?

Logically, yes, it is safe. But practically speaking, you will miss out on a plethora of marketing features when you use a personal profile for your Shopify store.

A business page can be optimized to get ranked in search engines like google, a personal profile cannot.

But, let’s imagine you are just starting, your business is yet to attract leads, then a personal profile might be feasible.

You can promote your Shopify store to your friends and families to acquire initial customers. But eventually, you’ll run out of friends, a personal profile allows only a maximum of 5000 friends, what will you do now?

That is why a business page is a viable option for a Shopify store in the long run. Now let’s dive into creatine one.
