Trust the statistics, **the probability of selling to an existing customer is 60-70% while the probability of selling to a new customer prospect is just 5%-20%**.

As aforesaid, the following are the reasons why it is always preferable to invest in customer retention.

## 1. Existing customers spend more

Your existing customers won't deny coupons and discounts offered by you. They are willing to spend an average of 13%, which is quite a huge term. Series of analysis says that customers are ready to spend on online stores that they are already familiar with.

Trusting in new brands or stores is mostly not preferred by people. Why do they trust in brands they have already indulged in purchases with? Because they have every idea of how purchasing with them works.

Positive experience says it all!  A study by Bain and Company found that regular customers spend more leading to larger transactions.

## 2. Promotion is always under cost

There is even no need to promote your brands every often to your existing customers. You can save the cost of promoting, campaigning and advertising. This comes easy right?
All you got to do is to inform them on a regular basis. By this we mean, sending newsletters, notifications regarding any new offers or updates.

Cost efficient and less cumbersome is investing in customer retention. Whereas, when you draw a parallel comparison with customer acquisition, you have to be prepared to face the financial expenditures. Imagine the cost of advertising through ad campaigns and email promotions. You’ll then understand why we should focus on customer retention more.

## 3. Customer Retention bring in more profits

Wondering how is that possible?
Alright, you call your existing customers loyal. Why? Because more than just frequent purchasing habits, they never complain about your brand. If at all, they complain, you can consider it as feedback. Most importantly, they refer your brand to others. This is called as referrals.

When someone so familiar with your brand suggests it to the people they know, you get profits more than you expect. <link-text url="https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/word-of-mouth-marketing-strategies-infographic" target="\_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Word-of-mouth marketing strategy</link-text> it is!

Customer lifetime value is all about estimating how much a customer has invested in your company for a lifetime. By this process, you will get to understand a few important stats of how much development your brand has improved because of your existing customers.
