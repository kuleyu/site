Ever heard of the saying, ***“The secret to success is to treat all customers as if your world revolves around them”.*** This saying goes very well with the customer base you have already gained or otherwise what you call as existing customers. 

Existing customers mean much more profit to that of new customers. This can be vividly explained through the process of Customer Retention Rate.

<toc></toc>

## What is Customer Retention Rate?

Customer Retention Rate in its simplest sense is trying to retain more customers for a longer period of time so they spend more over their lifetime. It is the process of retaining old customers than investing in new leads.

Customer Retention Rate is very crucial in terms of understanding how satisfactory services you provide to your existing customers. To understand how existing customers and new customers are managed, we need to analyze the basic understanding of customer retention and customer acquisition.

## Customer Retention vs Customer Acquisition

Customer retention is the opposite of customer acquisition. When your online business tries to make new customers it is called as Customer Acquisition. To discern which is better, a few following criteria are to be considered and compared.
- **In terms of  facileness:**

Selling to existing customers are much easier and undemanding. Your existing customers very well know about your products and your service. So the task of campaigning and convincing becomes easier with existing customers.

- **Affordability:**

Customer Retention saves you more than acquiring new customers. Several statistics state that the affordability factor of new customer ranges between expense percentages of 25%-50%. Investing in new customers can prove to be a big threat to your financial hold.

- **Add-on profits with Existing customers:**

Your existing customer will be ready to spend 51% on new products. The likeliness to sell your products to your existing customer profits around 60%-70% while profits expected from new customers can be as less as 5%-7%. Your profit rates can also be calculated through new customers gained from the old ones

Yes, <link-text url="https://blog.accessdevelopment.com/the-top-ten-benefits-of-customer-retention" target="\_blank" rel="nofollow">you read it right.</link-text>

When an existing customer is contented by your products, he is more likely to spill the beans about your service by Word-of-mouth. 

**Word-of-mouth strategy** is by far the most powerful method of informal marketing. A happy customer brings ten more customers to your business. This strategy is much more efficient than promotion through ads and paid influencers. Your existing customers expect nothing in return for spreading positivity about your services while you need to pay for promotion via ads and influencers. 

After all, ***the purpose of business is to create a customer who creates customers.***

In consideration of all the above criteria, Customer Retention strategy is all the way for the win.
