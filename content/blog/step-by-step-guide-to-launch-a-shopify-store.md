### Test your store for every possible outcome

Once your store goes live, it would be too late for issues. Even Though you checked every component of your store before the launch, you might have missed the vital step in your Shopify Launch checklist;

“Customer’s perspective”

Your store will look different in the eyes of your customers, so you should test your store as a customer. Here is a list of what should you do as a customer for your store,

-   Check how fast is your website
    
-   Check the accessibility of the store
    
-   Make sure the contents are easy to interpret
    
-   Check how the store navigates a customer through their journey
    
-   Check how user-friendly it is.

Access your store like a customer would, review your content for errors, and check if the products are distinguished right as per their categories and variants.

You can place a trial order to see how the checkout page works and how fast it is. Double-check your payment gateway and see how secure it is.

As a developer, everything may seem great from your perspective, so ask your colleague or friends to test your store and sort out if any issues persist. Test, test, and test to strike off this step from your Shopify setup checklist.

### Add only essential apps

Stuffing your store with too many apps at the initial stage will cause your store to slow down or crash. You don’t need that happening in your new store.

Some apps won’t even be necessary for a new online store. So, it is wise to take things periodically.

When you are gearing up for the launch, install only the most essential apps as per your eCommerce site checklist depending on your industry. You can add the rest once your store gets up and running.

### Make customer support simple and effective

Customers will have many queries to sort out after the store is launched. Make it easier for customers to contact you so they can find a solution to their questions.

You’ll have to mention your address, contact number, and live chat in all the pages.

A recent study shows that the size of the cart increased by up to 48% when store owners chat with site visitors. With proper customer support, you can increase your brand value.  

Customers are more likely to return to your store when they feel you valued their presence in your store. Customer support may be a minor step in your Shopify launch checklist, but it is the most effective one.
