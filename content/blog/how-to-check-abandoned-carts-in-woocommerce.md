Here’s an example

-   Send the 1st cart email 1 hour after the customer abandons the cart.
    
-   The second email goes 3 hours after the cart is left abandoned.
    
-   The third, 1 day after abandonment.
    
-   And the final email, 2 days after the cart is being abandoned.

You can stop sending emails anywhere in between once your cart is recovered _(with Retainful, everything is automated. You just have to set it and forget it)._ <link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/docs/woocommerce/creating-an-abandoned-cart-email-sequence" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here’s a step by step guide to create abandoned cart recovery email reminders with Retainful.</link-text>
