### Step 2 - Define What you consider an abandoned cart

Once activating the plugin, you can find Retainful in your WordPress dashboard under WooCommerce.

Firstly before creating cart recovery email campaigns, you gotta be defining when can the customer cart be treated as an abandoned cart. 

This is important because you don’t wanna bother customers who haven’t actually abandoned their cart.

To set the condition, hit the **Settings** tab

Then,   
**When to consider a cart as abandoned?**  
This is the time to consider your customer cart abandoned.  
Say, if the time is set to 60 minutes, the WooCommerce cart will be considered abandoned when your customer left the cart unpaid for 60 minutes.

![Retainful Settings](../images/how-to-send-free-cart-recovery-emails-in-woocommerce/Retainful-settings.jpeg)

**How many days to wait before automatically deleting the cart?**   
This is to automatically delete the abandoned cart items after certain days if the WooCommerce customer still hasn’t recovered the abandoned for the set duration.

### Step 3 - Creating the abandoned cart recovery email campaign

You are one step less in automating your Cart recovery email campaigns.

Head to **Email Templates** tab to start scheduling the email reminders

To easily understand the process,    
**Let’s split the ‘Email Templates’ page into two parts**

**Part 1** - Email Sending Options

Enter the name and address you want your<link-text url="https://sleeknote.com/blog/abandoned-cart-emails" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> abandoned cart recovery emails</link-text> to be sent from.

That’s all about configuring the email settings.   
Now, click on **Create Template** to write your abandoned cart recovery email.

![Create Email Templates](../images/how-to-send-free-cart-recovery-emails-in-woocommerce/create-email-templates.jpeg)

Initially, enter the cart recovery email template and subject line. The **Template name** is for the reference of the store owner and not gets displayed to the customers. 

The **Template subject** is actually the subject line of your recovery email and so that’s going to be seen by your customer.

<call-out>
Simple and precise subject lines will achieve to improve email open rates.
</call-out>

Next, enter the body of your cart recovery email. The text editor may seem like the regular WordPress editor but the interesting part is the availability of shortcodes.   Shortcodes allow you to personalize the emails with the customer’s name, cart details, cart recovery link and more. 

The following screen shows you the proper way to structure your email using shortcodes.
