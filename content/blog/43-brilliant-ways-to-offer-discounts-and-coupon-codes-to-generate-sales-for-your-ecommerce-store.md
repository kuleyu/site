<div class="text-center">

_50% off your favorite styles._

_Grab the offer with the discount code FIFTYOFF._

</div>

Lines like these are a common sight on online stores. The eCommerce sector will perish without giving out offers. Customers hover to online shopping stores primarily for two reasons - convenience and offers.

But, here is a catch.

All eCommerce offers are not the same. You must have a knack to execute it the right way. If you don’t have it in you, nurture it right now with this blog post.

Let’s talk about offers, the types, ways to put it into practice, and the impact of it on eCommerce sales.

## What is an eCommerce offer?

With connection to eCommerce business and sales, an offer is a present that is given to a site visitor when they take the form of a customer. It is something similar to getting a return gift for attending a birthday party. This is the overview of an eCommerce offer.

In reality, eCommerce offers are more complicated and detail-oriented. Let’s take one step at a time.

First comes the categorization of eCommerce offers.

There are two types of eCommerce offers

-   Discounts
    
-   Coupon codes
    
### What is a discount?

A discount is usually a reduction in the original price of a product to be sold. In other words, the customer gets a product at a lower price or discounted rate.

For example, 75% off summer styles.

### What is a coupon code?

A coupon code is a string of characters and/or numbers that can be used to redeem an offer. It is a ticket to get the present that the customer deserves for purchasing a product. The other name for coupon code is promo code.

Coupon codes can be generated in two ways - either generic or personalized.

This is a generic coupon code from Kate Spade home page.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/1-generic-coupon-code-example.png)

Generic means any person who visits the website can avail the offer using this coupon code. No restrictions applied to the type of customer. The coupon code does not belong to anybody specifically.

This is a personalized coupon code from SkinStore as part of a referral program.

  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/2-personalized-coupon-code-example.png)

 
A personalized coupon code is meant to be used by only one customer, to whom the code is assigned. In some cases, like the above example, the coupon code is owned by one person but can be shared with others.

Hope that is clear. Moving on.

### Ways to project a discount and a coupon code for an eCommerce offer

Here are three methods to project a discount and a coupon code.

-   Discount alone
    

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/3-offer-example-with-only-discount.png)

This website ad from Nordstrom has only the discount offer mentioned. No coupon code is required here to check out the products included in this offer.

-   Coupon code alone
    
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/4-offer-with-only-coupon-code.png)

This is an email snippet from Kate Spade with just the coupon code ‘MAKEMATCH’. The cost mentioned is not the discount but the price of the wristlet itself.

-   Discount and coupon code in combination
    

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/5-offer-with-both-discount-and-coupon-code.png)

Kate Spade does it again. This example shows a discount offer in combination with a coupon code. This means this code ‘OOHLALA’ must be used by the customer to get the 20% off.

## How do you attract customers with eCommerce offers?

Now that you know how to project the discounts and coupon codes, let’s check out how to magnet customers with it.

As discussed before, an eCommerce offer is a present. The present must be apt to persuade a customer. The presents can be any of the following.

 - **Discount type**            
Don’t get confused here. A discount in itself will change a person’s mind but the type of discount matters even more. The discount types are two in number.

**1.  Flat-rate discount**              
In this type of discount, a fixed amount is deducted from the original price.
$10 off above $50 purchase

**2.  Percentage discount**             
Here, a percentage of the total amount is deducted.
5% off above $50 purchase
</br>
According to a study by <link-text url="https://www.klaviyo.com/blog/abandoned-cart-discounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Klaviyo</link-text>, while percentage discounts in abandoned cart emails were the most popular, it was flat-rate discounts that made the highest revenue.

- Free shipping                 
High costs for shipping is one reason for cart abandonment by many online shoppers. Taking this into account, giving a free shipping offer is a smart way to take things forward.

- Free product                  
Giving away free samples or rather even a full-sized product will make a number of people notice your brand, if marketed the right way.

- Cash                  
Redeemable cash can be offered to make subsequent purchases in an eCommerce store.

## Effects of eCommerce offers on sales         
What is the ultimate goal of setting promotional offers on eCommerce websites? Sales is one answer. Here is an insight into if offers will help in better sales.

Shopify emphasizes on giving out discounts and coupon codes for better sales. The team says that <link-text url="https://medium.com/hi-kit/the-stats-dont-lie-discount-codes-and-free-shipping-increase-sales-3ae1baa5d936" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sales increase likely by 8 times</link-text> if the promotional offers are active.

<br/>

AVON Cosmetics <link-text url="https://www.optimonk.com/case-study-how-avon-increased-its-sales-by-150/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">increased sales by 150%</link-text> in a year by using offers strategically after some good research of their audience base. The company mainly used coupon codes and free products for customer sign ups, reduce cart abandonment, and to promote seasonal sales like Black Friday.

Too much of anything is good for nothing. This is also the downside of promotional offers. Offers that show up on eCommerce sites regularly without proper planning tend to have a negative impact on sales. Profits margins are out at stake with regular discounts.

It is important to introspect the time intervals between promotional offers because people tend to perceive such brands as of low value and quality.

## Benefits of giving out offers for an eCommerce store

**Increased sales**                     
As previously discussed, sales will improve when offers are used smartly keeping customers as the focal point.

**Improved customer retention**                 
<link-text url="(https://www.ibeccreative.com/blog/do-coupon-codes-increase-conversion-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">93% of people sign up for loyalty programs</link-text> when they are subjected to special promotions. Increased loyalty program members mean more number of long-term customers and higher retention rates.

</br>

**Reduced cart abandonment**                
SalesCycle shows an example of how abandoned cart rates reduced during 2018 Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend compared to previous week. The week before had a cart abandonment rate of 85% and then it <link-text url="https://www.salecycle.com/blog/strategies/how-sales-affect-cart-abandonment-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollower">dipped to 80.9%</link-text> during Black Friday sales.

</br>

**Better brand awareness**                  
Coupon codes that highlight the brand build awareness among people. The existence of the brand gets imprinted in the minds of the customer on seeing the coupon codes in the email and social media.

## 43 Must-have offers for an eCommerce store to generate sales             
Practical examples will help you conceptualize the method to use offers in various ways for your eCommerce store to generate sales. Dive into this sea of 43 offers and learn without paying a dime.

### Offers based on customer action             
Offers that are provided by eCommerce stores based on customer activities are essential and the most effective way to generate sales. 11 types of offers based on customer action that consist of discounts, coupons, and promo codes are detailed here.

#### Subscription/Welcome offers                
Welcome offers popup within seconds of visiting a website. These welcome offers either target visitors to make an immediate purchase or subscribe to the newsletter in order to build the email list.

The below given is an example from Shinesty, a brand that sells swimwear, dresses, innerwear, and accessories for men and women. Shinesty chose to highlight the $10 offer by using it as a CTA. The validity of the offer is also mentioned as a microcopy.

Also, the welcome box is a double opt in which helps to get leads who are really interested to be a part of the email list. A healthy email list is guaranteed here and so is the sale.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/6-subscription-or-welcome-offer-example1.png)

<br>

On clicking the ‘Get $10 for free’, the second popup comes up asking for the email address. In return, the flat-rate discount is emailed to the inbox.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/7-subscription-or-welcome-offer-example2.png)

<br>

**Abandoned cart email offers**                 
<link-text url="https://financesonline.com/shopping-cart-abandonment-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eCommerce brands lose $18 billion every year</link-text> in the name of cart abandonment.
The rate is even higher for online retailers - $4 trillion.
The good news is that three-fourth of this lost revenue is recoverable.


**What should you do to not lose money at this rate?**
Simple. <link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/docs/woocommerce/creating-an-abandoned-cart-email-sequence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Send abandoned cart emails.</link-text> This is because experts say abandoned cart emails can recover 10% of lost revenue.

Not any regular abandoned cart email which goes 'Did you forget something?' and stuff like that. Go out of the way with an interesting <link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/blog/13-best-subject-lines-for-abandoned-cart-email-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abandoned cart email subject line</link-text> like ‘Hey, we have your shopping bag reserved. Get back here’. Also, give a discount offer that entices the customer to make the purchase.

This abandoned cart email from The Body Shop shows a product worth $15. It is being offered at $10. Any beauty freak will grab that discount offer. The 24hour time limit for the offer makes it compelling too.

Create similar abandoned cart emails with <link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Retainful</link-text>.

#### Exit intent offers                                      
Customers sometimes don’t find the product that they look for in one eCommerce website.         
It is said the most customers do a competitive analysis for price and quality before deciding on the purchase. So, people come and leave every minute.          
This happens on a daily basis. In your eCommerce store too.             
<link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/blog/how-to-setup-exit-intent-popups-for-abandoned-cart-recovery-in-woocommerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exit intent popup</link-text> with offers is a last minute effort to retain and engage the customer.          
Hannahpad offers a discount coupon of $10 to get subscribed before leaving the website.

#### Next order coupon offers                       
One successful sale does not guarantee the return of the customer for the next purchase.            
He might opt for another eCommerce site.            
So, how do you keep customers in the loop so that they choose your store by default the next time too?          
<link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/docs/woocommerce/next-order-coupon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Next order coupons</link-text> is the answer here. This is what they look like.

<br>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/10-next-order-coupon-offers-example.png)

Simple yet effective.                   
These next order coupon offers are sent along with transactional emails with details of a finished purchase.                
Here is how you can <link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/blog/how-to-provide-next-order-coupon-in-woocommerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provide a next order coupon with Retainful</link-text>.

#### Referral offers                
Referrals do wonders.               
Dropbox grew by 3900% with the help of their referral programs              
You want growth too, right?             
Devise a referral program but with sensible offers. Only when the customer and the friend is benefited from the referral offer, the program will pay back.              
This is a referral program with a discount offer by SkinStore.

 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/11-referral-offers-example.png)

<br>

25% off for the first purchase by the friend with a minimum spend limit.

$10 for every successful referral.  

Every customer who signs up as a SkinStore member has a dedicated referral list page with the personalized referral code and link. It also has the amount redeemable and the number of friends referred.

By the way, looking for a plugin to start a successful referral program. Try <link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/referrals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Retainful</link-text>.

#### Write-a-review offers                  
Most online shoppers simply leave, without registering a complaint, after a bad customer experience or for a poor quality product.

It is your maiden task to request a product review. This helps you to realize your standards as a brand and eCommerce business.

Now, review writing is considered a tedious or time-consuming thing to do. People find it unnecessary.

**How do you make it happen then?**             
Pay them for their time.

Give a discount offer or invite them for an ongoing contest.

Oliver Bonas nails the review request email with a chance to win €200 OB Gift card as part of a monthly draw.

#### Social sharing offers                  
Social reach for an eCommerce website is the need of the hour. Nearly half of the world’s population uses social media to connect with people and share information at a global level.
Your social presence as a brand will talk volumes.
Want people to celebrate your eCommerce business and keep coming back for more?

Just do this. Ask your customers to share their purchases, product reviews, photographs, and opinion on the social platforms.

In return, give them an offer like Jaimin Essence did.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/13-social-sharing-offers-example.png)

#### Bulk purchase offers               
Bulk purchases are not a regular sight when running an eCommerce portal. There is no harm in offering a discount in that case.

Corporates or resellers are the ones who come up with such requests. Dedicate a page for them on your website to cater to their doubts and questions.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/14-bulk-purchase-offers-example.png)

The image pictured above is part of a page from Fabindia website. All the terms and conditions to be fulfilled to make a bulk purchase is listed here clearly.

Set the right discounts as per your business niche and don’t ignore bulk purchases. It paves the way forward for better sales and revenue.

#### Pre-order offers               
Not every product is readily available in an online store. Some go out of stock and some can be purchased only by pre-ordering.

Coupons and discount offers can be used along with pre-orders. This is a strategy to get more people notice the product if it is a limited period sale.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/15-pre-order-offers-example.png)

SkinStore had this limited edition box offer message as part of a marketing email. A combo worth over $200 was being offered at just $88. That is close to 50% off on a pre-order.

The description in the message vouch for the originality of the products and hence there is no question of doubt here regarding the quality too.

#### Purchase history offers            
Purchase history of customers is sometimes overlooked. In reality, that is a rich database of customer preferences and expectations. LoyaltyOne says, <link-text url="https://makewebbetter.com/blog/boost-ecommerce-sales-digital-coupon-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">76% of customers</link-text> look forward to personalized discounts based on purchase history.

Skim and scan your purchase history rather than underutilizing it. Reach out to customers with personalized offers for products of their preference. You will see more sales coming your way. Moreover, it triggers your inactive user base.

#### Online retargeting offers                  
eCommerce websites and emails are not the only places to advertise offers, discounts, and promo codes. Make use of other social media to reinforce the offers implemented.

Facebook is the number one social medium with the highest number of users and so the perfect place to retarget customers online.

This is a Facebook retargeting post by Blue Apron.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/16-online-retargeting-offers-example.png)

<br>

The food business gives an offer of $30 for the first delivery after sign up. That is totally worth to opt for.

### Offers based on customer type               
Customers form the building blocks of eCommerce. Offers can be targeted to specific types of customer to give them a personalized experience.

#### First-time shopper offers              
New customers can be provided with an offer for their first purchase. With such nice treatment, the first-time offer will spread like wildfire.

Go for it. Give a discount offer and bring more people on board.

Photo Family Tree gives a 10% off for first-timers. Note that the email address is not asked for, unlike the subscription/welcome offer.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/17-first-time-shopper-offers-example.png)

#### Returning customer offers                  
Returning customers or repeat customers are the ones who come back for the second, third, and subsequent purchases.

Checkdepot offered a 5% off as a returning customer discount.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/18-returning-customer-discount-offer-example.png)

Now, returning customers can also become club members in order to enjoy regular uninterrupted deliveries, fun, surprises, and of course, savings.

Picky Bars, an online store that sells healthy snacks, invites returning customers to join their Picky Club.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/19-returning-customer-cum-club-member-offers-example.png)

The club categorizes members into 3 - Sweet, Sweeter, Sweetest. Relevant discount offers are associated with the tiers - 10%, 20%, 30%.

That is EPITOME OF SWEETNESS.

#### Loyal member/customer offers               
Demonstrating loyalty demands rewards and offers in return. The fact that <link-text url="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/customer-loyalty-statistics/#gref" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofolow">58% of customers</link-text> second it, as depicted by eMarketer, cannot be ignored.

Here is another stat.  

Almost three-fourth population of US adults are part of at least one loyalty program.

This is proof that loyalty programs do deliver.

Madewell has a loyalty program as shown below.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/20-loyal-customer-offers-example.png)


There are 3 tiers - Insider, Star, and Icon.

The customers have to simply sign up for the first tier. Whereas, the second and third tiers require meeting a condition of annual expenditure on Madewell purchases.

The offers of being a Madewell loyal member are detailed in the below cheat sheet. Everything is free other than the primary purchases. Special gifts, early access, and invitations to special events are included too.

It is worthy to note that the basic tier itself can avail 7 out of 10 offers listed in the cheat sheet. So, the number of tier 1 members might equal the combined numbers of tier 2 and 3. This means more sales at the basic level itself.

 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/21-loyal-customer-offers-benefits.png)


#### Influencer offers

An influencer is a person who helps in marketing your eCommerce products. Can they help generate sales and revenue?

 Oh, yes!

But that comes at a price.

You need to give special discounts and offers to influencers too like how Chubbies did.

Chubbies recently conducted ‘The Stay IN-Fluencer Competition’. Thanks to COVID-19 pandemic for that name.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/22-influencer-offers-competition-example.png)

The contest had over 2000 submissions. What were they asked to do?

Create viral content, mostly photos, and videos that market Chubbies shorts. Not just one or two. As many and frequently as possible was the condition and do it from home.

The contest winner was meant to be 1 person along with 4 runners-up. The response was so overwhelming that Chubbies team ended up adding 5 more runners-up to the list of winners.

Here is Brandon Duck, one of the runners-up. Rewarded with the title Chubbies Stay IN-Fluencer, $250 vacation post the lockdown time, and free Chubbies products. All the other runners-up got the same reward.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/23-influencer-offers-example.png)

The grand prize winner was Lucas Smith and guess what he got for his efforts.

Lifetime supply of Chubbies products, $1000 vacation post isolation, and the official title of Chubbies Stay IN-Fluencer.

With such great rewards, wouldn’t he spread the word and introduce the brand to more people? He will.

#### Affiliate partner offers           
Affiliate partners can change the fate of an eCommerce site. This is the success behind Amazon which has the largest affiliate network in the world.

Affiliate partners market products and bring in traffic to eCommerce sites they work for. They get paid with a commission for a sale.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/24-affiliates-partner-offers-example.png)

<br>

UK based Estee Lauder has an affiliate program that is one of a kind. It stands out for the perks offered to customers that the affiliates bring in.

When most affiliate programs restrict to giving special and personalized discount offers, Estee Lauder goes a step further with the following benefits.

-   7- day returns
    
-   Free delivery
    
-   2 free samples per order
    
-   4 free samples for orders above €60
    
-   Access to exclusive product launches every month
    
With such benefits, sales is bound to hit the roof.

#### Student offers                 
Students are a special group of customers. When governments and other organizations all over the world can provide discounts and offers to them for educational needs, why not eCommerce sites do the same?

Most laptop manufacturers and sellers provide special discounts for students.

Lenovo has a special page for student discounts on their website. The company provides an additional 10% discount.

The only condition is that the student ID must be verified to redeem the discount offer.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/25-student-offers-example.png)

#### Military personnel offers              
Military service members serve a country with utmost devotion and patriotism. You will stand apart from other eCommerce sites if you consider giving them a discount offer too.

Here is the page from Chubbies that displays the discount for military members.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/26-military-offers-example.png)

The page simply asks for verification, using an external app, to access the 10% reward code. Try doing this with your eCommerce site too.

### Offers based on eCommerce store needs

No eCommerce store is the same. The goals, audience, revenue, literally everything varies and so does the need to achieve them. Here are offers based on if an eCommerce store wants to set up a quick sale, launch a product, sell out one type of brand, and more.

#### Flash sale offers

Flash sales increase transaction rates <link-text url="http://socialmarketingfella.com/daily-deals-flash-sales-stats-need-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">by 35%</link-text>. The reason behind it is the limited time that the sale is active for. The lesser the time, the more will be the response.

Chubbies announced a flash sale with a discount offer of up to 60%.

More than 30 styles of shorts were part of the flash sale.

A steep discount like this for a flash sale is not going to cost you because the time limit is in your hand. Drop the discount offer when you feel you have had enough sales.

#### One-day offers

An offer that lasts a day. Just a day.

This usually is announced as a surprise and unexpected sale.

Kate Spade offered up to 75% off everything for one day.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/28-one-day-offers-example.png)

Any customer who comes across this ad will definitely take a look at the set of products put up for the surprise sale. This is solely because of the ad copy.

 **TODAY ONLY!**

Flap crossbody for $59*

Tomorrow $79

Originally $199

The sharp increase in price if the one day offer is missed out is indicated clearly below the product image. Wouldn’t you give it a go?

#### Daily/Weekly/Monthly offers

eCommerce sites also come up with daily, weekly, and monthly offers. Ashford, a website that sells different brands of watches, has a separate tab for weekly deals on their homepage

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/29-weekly-offers-example.png)

<br>

The discount is as high as 96% for the featured products of various styles. No wonder why people will throng the website to find their wristwatches of preferred styles.

#### Countdown offers

The use of a countdown timer in a sale ad creates an urgency in the minds of the customer.
Here is an example from the BestBuy website.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/30-countdown-offers-example.png)

‘Deal of the Day’ offer had a countdown timer of 24hours of which 20 hours were left to avail the offer.                
The page also displayed some of the products that were included for the sale of the day.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/31-countdown-offer-products.png)

</br>
  
<link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/docs/woocommerce/coupon-timer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Countdown timer for a coupon offer</link-text>can be applied with ease by purchasing the premium version of Retainful plugin. The timer can be set for Days/Hours/Minutes even by a novice. It is that easy. The display position and the page can also be chosen as per your eCommerce site needs.

#### Limited time offers

FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out is an emotion. Customers experience this when subjected to offers that have a time limit.                    
Kate Spade utilized this to give up to 60% discount for exquisite bags.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/32-limited-time-offers-example.png)

The banner on the website also mentioned the end date and time of the sale as a microcopy beneath the image. This reinforces the authenticity of the offer.                     
The highlighted ‘LIMITED TIME’ creates an FOMO to grab the discount offer before the sale ends.

#### Pre-launch offers

There is no better way to introduce a product than presenting a pre-launch offer. Organic Harvest used this tactic to get more people into buying the product.                  
Free Sheet Mask for Micellar water.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/33-pre-launch-offers-example.png)

<br>

Point to be noted here is that the free product given here is something relevant to the new product to be launched. Both sheet mask and micellar water are meant to beautify the face.                  
This might have failed if the free product was a lipstick. With a relevant and thoughtful choice of free sheet mask, the purpose of the micellar water is fulfilled. Why wouldn’t people give it a try?

#### Introductory offers

There is only a fine line of difference between a pre-launch offer and an introductory offer. Pre-launch offer is given away before the product is launched and the introductory offer is meant to stay for a certain period of time after the launch.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/34-introductory-offers-example.png)

<br>

Flycart website has an offer banner for a new <link-text url="https://www.flycart.org/products/wordpress/woocommerce-gift-cards?coupon=GIFT20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WooCommerce gift card plugin</link-text>. The coupon code is provided. The introductory offer is revealed on applying the code.               

#### Store-wide offers
Offers are not a rare sight but store-wide offers are. A discount offer on anything and everything that the customer purchases in your online store.                    
Just give it away and wait for the sales graph to increase at jet-speed.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/35-store-wide-offers-example.png)

West Elm is an eCommerce site that sells furniture, other related products and accessories. They presented a site-wide offer as part of the good vibes sale.                    
Flat 20% off any furniture and flat 25% off every other product. No conditions apply.                   
That is insane but it hit the right chord among customers.              

#### Product-specific offers
Certain categories of products can be put up for sale when the need arises.                     
West elm chose to discount dining furniture.                
The message was loud and clear with the email subject line.             

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/36-product-specific-offer-subject-line.png)
  
With the mention of the 20% off, an apt description for the dining furniture, and a beautiful image of one of their products, the marketing is done right.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/37-product-specific-offer-example.png)

People will never mind taking a peek by clicking the ‘Shop Now’ CTA, especially when an original product is featured with perfection.
With this, the incoming traffic increases. Your cash registers will overflow.

#### Brand-specific offers

**Are offers applicable only for product types?**
Never. You can provide an offer for select brands too.                  
This was an email from SkinStore. The store has a wide range of cosmetics that belong to various brands.                    
One of their marketing emails was meant specifically for one brand - Obagi.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/38-brand-specific-offers-example.png)

The email was all about Obagi discount offer promotion.                 
The huge font, an overview of the Obagi products along with the brand-specific code and image, is complete in itself.                   
That is why it is named a ‘brand-specific offer’.           

#### BOGO offers

Buy One Get One - BOGO offer.                   
Nothing much to say here. The customer is given 2 products at the price of 1.                   
Motorola came up with such a deal just months after launching Razr but for a limited time.          

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/39-BOGO-offers-example.png)

<br>

**Want to apply the same to your eCommerce site?**
Try <link-text url="https://www.flycart.org/products/wordpress/woocommerce-discount-rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discount Rule for WooCommerce plugin</link-text> - a Wordpress plugin to set up offers for your online store.                     
You get the liberty to choose the products for which the offer must be applied. Also, oversee and control the number of customers availing the activated offers.                

#### Bundled offers
Do you have products in your eCommerce inventory that can be bundled up to make a combo?                    
Grab them all and start creating bundles.           
Then?                   
Slash some price off the total to make customers happy.                 
Bundles can be created with any number of products - 2,3, or even 7. It totally depends on the type of product sold.            

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/39-bundled-offers-example.png)

Kate Spade created several bundles that consisted of a handbag and a purse. The bundle cost $418. With a discount offer, the price slid down to $99.                        
Use the code and you get the offer. The relevant code and CTA for a bundled discount completes the offer.                       

#### Upsell/Cross-sell offers

Upsell and cross-sell offers is one strategy to drive more sales into your eCommerce store. Recommend similar or relevant products and that is an upsell. When different products are recommended, that becomes cross-sell.

 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/40-upsell-offers-example.png)

<br>

This is an upsell example accompanied by a 20% discount offer on the entire order. The offer is valid only when the products are added to the cart. With upsell/cross-sell offers, the average order value (AOV) increases, leading to a spike in sales. Better sales, higher revenue.

#### Free shipping/Free returns offers

<br>

Online shopping skyrockets sales with the presence of a free shipping offer. It is said that around <link-text url="https://www.walkersands.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Walker-Sands_2018-Future-of-Retail-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">79% of people</link-text>expect this offer when shopping online. Why not utilize this scenario?

Free returns is also an issue to be addressed because most customers are unsatisfied with the returns policy. This sometimes doubles up as a reason for cart abandonment.                   
Here is an example from MVMT that sells watches. They have clearly mentioned the ‘Free shipping’ offer as a banner and as a footer on their website. Free returns can be availed when the order value of $50 is met.
This kind of projection answers the insecurities of the customers regarding free shipping and free returns.             

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/41-free-shipping-free-returns-offers-example.png)

Free shipping can also be combined with other kinds of discounts and coupons. Walmart does it by combining it with a site-wide offer of $10 when a purchase of $50 is made.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/42-free-shipping-offers-with-discount-example.png)

#### Clearance sale offers
Clearance sales usually happen once a year. Some businesses even term it as an ESOS - End Of Season Sale but there is no official norm regarding this.                      
Nowadays, it so happens that clearance sales can be advertised whenever the stocks in the inventory need to be cleared out. This means you can provide clearance sale offers at any time of the year.               

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/43-clearance-sale-offers-example.png)

Boden came up with a clearance sale offer of up to 50% for fashion clothing. It was conveyed via email and of course, was advertised on the website too.                
Clear your stocks right away.               

#### Giveaway offers
Online contests are a real crowd-puller. This is an opportunity to generate more sales than normal. Contests with giveaways reach a wider audience because people love free stuff.                  
Bhu Foods realized this and started a giveaway contest. The prize?
6 months supply of ‘low sugar chocolate chips’ valued at $240.              
What more can a health and diet freak ask for? The contest nailed it by reaching out to the right audience.             

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/44-giveaway-offers-example.png)

#### Credit Card offers
Regular customers can be asked to sign up for credit card offers. The presence of a credit card ensures that customers return from time to time to avail the offer.                     
This is an example of a credit card offer from West Elm - a furniture retailer.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/45-credit-card-offers-example.png)

<br>
West Elm credit card comes with an array of tempting offers.

-   $50 welcome reward
    
-   10% cashback as reward after a purchase
    
-   12-month financial help to make a purchase
    
-   Birthday reward
    
-   Access to special shopping events
    
-   Separate customer service line
    
With so many customer benefits, it is tough to ignore the credit card offer.                    
Set the right perks along with T&C. Serve the customers right.
That’s it. You will witness products flying off your shelves.

#### Cash-as-reward offers
A discounted price is not the only offer that can be availed. Customers will be excited to receive cash too.                    
Yes, you heard that right. C-A-S-H.                     
Scary to think of it? Probabilities are that you might run out of business pretty soon if implemented.                  
Here is how Kohl’s did it right.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/46-cash-as-reward-offers-example.png)

<br>

Kohl’s cash program offered the cash in the form of coupons. These cash coupons also have the redemption dates during which they can be used to make a purchase at Kohl’s store.                        
This kind of a cash program ensures that the money never circulates outside the limits of the business. The chances of a fall out are grim here with the ever increasing number of returning customers.

#### Distress time offers 

<br>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/47-distress-time-offers-example.png)

<br>

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is an eye-opener for multiple reasons. The world witnessed and experienced many helping hands and the eCommerce sector was no exception.                      
Many eCommerce retailers reached out to front-line workers to suffice the supply of food and dress. Businesses came up with offers so that troubled operations of fellow brethren can be dealt with.                    
Moz Academy gave away their SEO certification courses, usually priced at above $100, for free. Absolutely free to all! You only have to sign up and type in the promo code at the checkout.             

#### In-store purchase offers
In-store offers are not common but they do work to magnet more people into your brick-and-mortar store.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/48-in-store-purchase-offers-example.png)

Bed Bath & Beyond offered a 20% off a single item for in-store purchase after making an online reservation. The offer expiry is a good idea to trigger the customer into initiating the buy.                
Who knows? The customer's eyes do wander at the time of pickup which might even result in him going back with more products than anticipated.

#### Location-based offers

Offers based on location favor eCommerce businesses that possess a chain of offline stores too. It is practically impossible to give the same offer to a store in the US and to a store in India. This is where location-based offers come into play.               
Weight Watchers is a company that crafts weight loss plans for people to lead a healthy lifestyle. Due to the current pandemic, the company conducts weight loss workshops virtually.               
Even with the digital/virtual workshops, location-based offers can be availed.                          
Here is a popup from the Weight Watchers website. It asks to fill in the ZIP code to find the best offer according to the area.             

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/49-location-based-offers-example.png)

On giving a California ZIP CODE along with the email address, the below page showed up.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/50-location-based-offer1.png)

Once again, ZIP CODE was requested. It was 94203.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/51-location-based-offer2.png)

Immediately, the cost for the specified ZIP CODE was shown. This was confirmed with the below message.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/52-location-based-offer3.png)

Do you have stores in multiple locations? High time you start offering location-based discount offers.

### Offers based on occasions
These days occasions without gifts seem meaningless in this materialistic world. Make use of this to sell better on all noteworthy days.

#### Seasonal and holiday offers
Seasonal offers come around the time of summer, spring, autumn, and winter. Christmas is the time for holiday offers.                   
40% off for the Christmas season.                   
Boden sent this email to their customer base to initiate the Christmas sale. The sight of this email elevates the spirit to take on the offer without a second thought.                 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/53-holiday-offers-example.png)

#### Special day offers
Special days require surprises.                 
And surprises take the form of gifts.               
Gifts on offers is a double-surprise for customers.                 
Father’s day, Mother’s day, Valentine’s day, and other days like these are the times for special offers.                    
JCPenney put up a Mother’s day discount offer for fine and fashion jewelry this year too.                   

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/55-special-day-offers-example.png)

#### Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers

Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday sales are the best time of the year to give an offer. These stats prove it.                
In the US,

-   Cyber Monday sales increased from $7.9bn in 2018 to $9.2bn in 2019.
    
-   Black Friday sales saw a spike from $6.2bn in 2018 to $7.4bn in 2019.
    
These sales are the fore-runner to the Winter holiday, Christmas, and New Year sales.               
Madewell’s Cyber Monday discount deal gives an extra discount along with the basic 30% discount offer.                      
The countdown timer clearly denotes that the sale has already started and to avail the offer ‘WHILE YOU CAN’.                   

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/54-cyber-monday-offers-example.png)

#### Birthday and anniversary offers
Everyone celebrates a birthday. It is not meant for people alone. Being a customer-centric business, you can celebrate their birthdays with a personalized offer.               
But this example is different. This is about celebrating your online store’s birthday.              
UK based Boden turned 28 recently.              
They gave a 28% off on the entire order purchased by every customer.
The discount lasted for 5 days.         
Time to celebrate!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/43-brilliant-ways-to-offer-discounts-and-coupon-codes-to-generate-sales-for-your-ecommerce-store/56-birthday-offers-example.png)

## The Way forward
Your job as an eCommerce store owner is not done once you put up products for sale. The real work starts now.       
You must have a keen eye on how your promotional offer strategies are being welcomed by the customer. Keep tracking all the necessary metrics like conversion rates, revenue generated, customer preferences, which offers perform well, and many more.             
Put the offers that perform badly in the back burner and hold on to the ones that do well. Bring about consistent changes to the offers such that they align with the customer needs and expectations.          

## Final Thoughts

Offers with discounts and coupon codes do work given that you know the way to make the magic happen. Period.
Also, don’t stick on only to the offers in this post. Go beyond the horizon and keep evolving with the changing times.
Rediscover your business and cement your hold in the eCommerce sector.
