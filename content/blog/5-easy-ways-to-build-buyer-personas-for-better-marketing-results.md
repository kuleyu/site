## What are Buyer Personas

A buyer persona is the fictional depiction of your ideal or target customers based on the buyer persona research you made. The research is carried out on the respective market and also on the existing customers of your Shopify store.

A healthy reminder, your buyer or marketing persona should never be built on a specific individual rather it should represent a group of potential customers.

## Why create buyer personas for your eCommerce store?

For instance, you may know who your potential customers are but do you know their personal interests? Do you know what they need? To answer these questions is why you need to build buyer personas for your Shopify store.

Buyer persona research is a great way to get to know your potential customers. It helps you to strategize your campaign based on their interests, you can direct your content and services based on their behaviours.

Creating ideal buyer personas exposes who your marketing to so that you can initiate your marketing campaign based on those buyer personas.

## How to build buyer personas for your eCommerce store?

### Perform an audience research

The initial step in building buyer personas is conducting a complete buyer persona research on your audience. You can discover interesting information about your customers, which you didn't know before, by studying your audience.

So, how to research buyer personas?

Start with your existing audience, find out how they have perceived your content before if your results aren’t bright, then change your content strategy.

<br>

See who your best customers are, find out what your best and also repeated customers have in common.

These buyer persona research will show who you should target on your next campaign to increase the sales of your eCommerce store.

By now, you’ll be wondering how do I gather this information?

**Create a survey :** Your existing customers will already be satisfied with your service so it gives you a great opportunity to learn more about them. Create a survey though your Social media and find out what interests/disinterests them.

**Face-to-Face interviews :** A conventional and effective way to garner information if your budget permits. You can know in-depth about their frustrations, interests and goals through focus groups and interviews.

**Cross-check your analytics :** There are many analytics tools that can furnish you with details of who are interacting with your site from where and when. These demographics can help you tailor your content.

**Phone calls and Emails :** You can always use the conventional method of a phone call or an interview. But most B2B marketers nowadays use emails to gather customer information.

<br>

To collect information with minimal effort, conduct a survey by sending a few questions to your <link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/blog/10-steps-to-build-your-email-list-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email list</link-text>. Questions like,

1.  What objections do you have for our product?
    
2.  When do you open your emails?
    
3.  Do you have any questions regarding our services?
    
4.  How do you prefer to communicate?
    
5.  What questions would you ask yourself before buying a product?
    
6.  What are the challenges you face?
    
These are the few questions we ask our customers to build our ideal buyer personas. We hope we showed you how to research buyer personas now let’s jump into segmenting them.

### Segmenting your buyer personas

Now that you know how to research buyer personas and have collected all the necessary information, the next step in how to build buyer persona is to segment it.

Our main motive is to build a target audience, so without segmenting your information you cannot narrow down your audience.

**Why should I segment my audience to send emails?**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/Buyer-persona/3-Email-marketing.png)

<br>

If you don’t narrow down your audience you’ll be targeting your content to the wrong audience.

<link-text url="http://valcort.com/5-ways-to-segment-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Audience segmentation</link-text> allows you to tailor your message to the needs and interests of each and every customer.

This is a great way to touch the pain points of every customer and increase your engagement which eventually boosts your conversions.

For instance, imagine selling a tech device that appeals to tech lovers. If you don’t segment your customers before sending emails they will reach the inboxes of non-techie customers which will get them frustrated.

So, avoid frustrating and start segmenting.

<br>

This is how <link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retainful</link-text> segments and creates buyer personas based on the information we received,

-   Demographics
    
-   Frustrations or pain points
    
-   Goals
    
-   Interests
    
-   Revenue
    
-   Email Preferences
    
So it is easy for us to tailor our messages to our segmented target audience to <link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/blog/ecommerce-email-campaigns-that-could-help-your-drive-conversion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">achieve better conversions.</link-text>

### Focus on customer frustrations/pain points

What troubles are your customers facing? What keeps them from achieving their goals? You need to ask these questions if you want to engage with them better.

A customer frustration/pain point is the issue that your customers are facing which can be resolved with your products.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/Buyer-persona/5-Pain-points.png)

<br>

Acknowledge their pain points, it will make your promotion easy. Moreover, people will be willing to buy from you if you can effortlessly display how your products can solve their issues.

To understand their pain points you need to know the types of pain points they face. Through our experience, we classified pain points into three types,

**Based on price** - Your potential customers are investing too much in their current product, now they’re looking for a cost-effective alternative.

**Based on products** - Your potential customers are looking to spend their time efficiently on a better product.

**Based on Support** - Your potential customers aren’t satisfied with the customer support they get on their current product.

Classifying their pain points in categories will help you to devise a plan, through which you can take your products to your potential customers to solve their frustrations.

The next challenge is, <link-text url="https://surveysparrow.com/blog/guide-finding-customer-pain-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identifying their pain points</link-text>.  

<br>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/Buyer-persona/6-Frustrations.png)

<br>

You can use the time tested method of sending an email and asking them about the issues they are facing. You can also tell how you can solve their issues.

These are the effective ways we use to identify customer pain points,

-   Sending an email and asking them directly.
    
-   Initiating research on our audience.
    
-   Asking them through chat or phone calls.
    
We succeeded in identifying their pain points by employing these tactics, you can do it too or you can try experimenting with your resources too.

Always remember, the more you invest in the satisfaction of your potential customer, the more conversions you get. So, go ahead.

### Identifying your customer goals

We have seen the customer pain points, now it’s time to flip the coin, customer goals it is.

Customer goals are what they need or what they are trying to reach/achieve. These goals might be personal or professional depending on their position.

Now you’ve to see how your eCommerce product can help your customer in achieving his/her goal. Even if your products don’t relate to their goals it will help you get a better understanding of your customer.

A better way to approach this strategy is by anticipating their goals or needs.

An interesting aspect of anticipating customer’s needs is that you can tailor your content, or even add some more features to your product to reach their goals.

Here is how you can identify customer goals,

1.  Focus groups
    
2.  Social listening
    
3.  Keyword research
    
Social listening is a great way to identify customer goals because your sales teams know how customers react to your products so ask them and learn what your customer needs from you and act.

### Creating buyer personas

So, now you’ve collected all the necessary details like demographics, pain points, and goals, let’s move on to the next step by assembling them to build personas.

Wait, how do I get customer demographics?

Glad, you asked.

You know, asking for an individual’s age, their location might feel awkward for both parties concerned. In that case, you can always conduct surveys to find out those details.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/Buyer-persona/7-Demographics.png)

<br>

Because people will feel comfortable to disclose these pieces of information through a survey rather than in personal communication.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/Buyer-persona/8-Age-distribution.png)

<br>

Back to creating personas, a major question that arises when creating a persona is, how do I assemble these details to build ideal buyer personas?

Pretty easy, just look for the customers that have similar interests, goals, or pain points and sort them as an individual persona. Look for people who share similar demographics and sort them as a different persona.

Effortless, isn’t it? Your task would be even easier if you use a buyer persona template.


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/Buyer-persona/9-Buyer-persona-template.png)

<br>

A best practice is to give your persona a name and a live picture so your team will get a fictional representation of who they are targeting with the campaigns.
