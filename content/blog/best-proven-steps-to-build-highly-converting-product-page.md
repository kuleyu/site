### Craft the best product description

When images & videos complete 50% of the intended job, product page contents are responsible for the other 50%.

Recent research found that about 20% of failed sales were a direct consequence of an improper explanation of the product or inadequate product page content.

Meanwhile, the best practice is to write about how the product will be useful to the customer. In that way, customers can understand the product better.

<br>

You see what Nike did here, they turned the shoe’s features into benefits. This proven strategy will entice the customers to make a purchase and boost your sales along the way.

By writing a reliable, informative, and entertaining product page content, a copywriter helps serves as same as a sales associate does when anyone comes to the front door of the store.

### Provide product details and options

Now you have crafted the basic description of a product, is it enough to convince a customer?

Certainly not!

To make it appealing, you must be much more precise. Customers may have some product-related doubts like (What size is that? What are the dimensions? How much does it weigh? etc).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/best-proven-steps-to-build-highly-converting-product-page/5-product-details.png)

Now you will have an abandoned cart to deal with, <link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/blog/10-best-ways-to-reduce-abandoned-carts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cart abandonment</link-text> is the last thing you want to happen on your product page. But there is always a way to <link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recover your abandoned cart</link-text> and convert it into revenue.

Another key aspect that customers will look for on the product page is the options available for the product.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/best-proven-steps-to-build-highly-converting-product-page/6-product-options.png)

<br>

So, adding all the available options is what makes a good product page and it will help the customer make a quick and better decision.

### Provide the proof of authenticity

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/best-proven-steps-to-build-highly-converting-product-page/11-retain-fuul-prices.png)

<br>

Ecommerce Stores around the world use this strategy to sell products in demand or to clear out their inventory. If you want a product page that converts you need to include these exclusive deals

An effective way to achieve this is by adding an urgency clock to the product to showcase that the product will not available for a specific deal after the time runs out.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/best-proven-steps-to-build-highly-converting-product-page/13-add-to-cart.png)

<br>

The wishlist helps customers to save an item and come back oat any time to complete the purchase. It will also save them the time of searching for the product again.

### Add FAQs to clear out queries

Customers tend to rise a lot of questions before making the purchase decision. So, the best practice is to provide answers to their queries on your eCommerce product page to keep them from abandoning your store.
