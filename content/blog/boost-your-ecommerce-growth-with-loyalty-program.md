<br>

### Membership

Provide membership to your customers. By this, you convince your customers to stay committed to your brand for a defined period of time.

  

This is a very advantageous strategy where you being the owner get to communicate with your customers regularly. Especially you can move towards customer segmentation by making a list of your membership customers. This facilitates a personalized approach towards your loyal customers. And as a reward for your fellow customers, you can benefit them with discounts, offers and so on for joining into membership.

You get a fair idea about the product demand and can decide how much stock to keep.

### Brand collaboration

By working with another brand you get more exposure to develop yours.  This is one of the best cross-promotional strategies. It also helps you to cut down your marketing cost factor. Here this gives rise to an interesting scenario like,

“Your customers are my customers, my customers are your customers”

  

Collaborators usually tend to promote their niche products and services. Like an eCommerce, the home appliance store will collaborate with a bank.

  

In the below example you can buy any of our home appliances with credit/debit cards from the below-mentioned bank and redeem the bonus.

### Let us play a game with loyalty

There is a general opinion that most of the loyalty programs appear the same and not so engaging. So, it will be effective to introduce the ones that are unique and fun-filled. Once in awhile engage your customers by providing entertainment and then convert that event into sales.

  

Here what you can do is like involving your customers in fun game activity. Then convert the points secured during the game into credits to avail offers by which you can motivate customers to make a purchase.

  

In the below example spin the wheel win 50 points with which you can avail 50% off on 100 plus products from our store.

![Let us play a game with loyalty](../images/boost-your-ecommerce-growth-with-loyalty-program/4-spinthewheel-loyalty-program.jpg)

### Social Rewards

Social reward focuses on providing discounts that are given as a reward for a customer’s social media promotions about your business.

As social media has become an irresistible marketing platform, marketers and researchers are looking for the best ways and strategies to utilize the same.

  

**Eg:** Earn 5 credit points after tweeting about our brand, sharing our post. You can later use the 5 points as a discount during purchase.

### Referral rewards

Referral rewards mainly include “invite and earn” promotional strategies. Here a customer earns rewards for bringing in new customers.

With referral rewards, you can motivate word of mouth promotions from your customers. Word of mouth is known to be one of the best loyalty rewards achieved.

  

**Eg:** Refer and earn a gift card worth $20 for your next purchase.

### Discounts for loyalty

Discounts do not just stop with attracting customers they also help you maintain your customer base intact. Because you can do a lot with it like giving a very straight forward 10 percent offer to a complex conditional discount. But before giving discounts please note that it is always recommended to learn about <link-text url="https://www.flycart.org/blog/woocommerce/beginners-guide-to-woocommerce-discounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discount types</link-text>, understand each of its benefits and how to set up them first.

  

Here in the below example, there are 3 unique products in your cart A, B, and C. Provided you are buying 10 pieces of A, one piece of B and C. Here you can set up discounts by providing the product with the lowest price among the products in your cart for free.

  

![Discounts for loyalty](../images/boost-your-ecommerce-growth-with-loyalty-program/3-Complex-discount-loyalty-program.png)

#### Discounts that attracts loyalty

Though your regular customer gets the title “loyal customer” also consider bulk purchasers, special customers who make purchases with a higher value into your loyalty programs. You can surprise them with bulk discounts, tiered pricing, <link-text url="https://www.flycart.org/blog/wordpress/how-to-setup-dynamic-pricing-in-woocommerce" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dynamic pricing</link-text> and so on using a <link-text url="https://www.flycart.org/products/wordpress/woocommerce-discount-rules" rel="noopener" target="_blank">discount plugin.</link-text> This can potentially convert your valuable customers into loyal ones.

### Different tiers of loyalty programs

How will you exactly weigh loyalty? Reward your customers based on their level of loyalty. Well, you can engage different customers into different sets of loyalty programs.

  

Because customer segmentation based on their shopping behavior opens up wide scopes for increasing revenue. Providing loyalty benefits for customers who have completed less number of purchases encourages initial loyalty for more purchases.

  

**Eg:** Gift card worth $20 for customers who had made orders worth $1000 so far.

10% off on total cart for customers who had made orders worth $600 so far.

### Upfront payment for loyal customers

A Loyal customer itself denotes those who do regular purchases. Hence why not collect advance payment from them?

Upfront payments are highly beneficial from a regular customer’s point of view as it turns out to be cheaper than regular payment. It also ensures regular product/service supply and hidden cost shocks are avoided. From the store owner’s point of view, there are still greater benefits like predictable cash flow, receiving an advance payment, customer retention and so on.

  

In the below example you are subscribing to a weekly veggie box for which you are paying up front.

### Loyalty program with a philanthropic aspect

There are many institutions, firms, governmental and non-governmental organizations where philanthropy is one of their vision and mission. If you and your business also intend to behold such ideologies, you can very well involve your customers to contribute towards the same. Because the idea of contributing to the needy can motivate customers to buy more.

Here is one of the successful loyalty programs examples below.

  

In the below example you buy one of these eco-friendly toothbrushes from <link-text url="https://smilesquared.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Smile Squared</link-text> and you donate one to the needy.
