### Subject line 

After examining 50+ abandoned cart subject lines from the emails collected, some real interesting facts came to light. Read on.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/how-to-create-the-perfect-abandoned-cart-email-template-case-study/2-abandoned-cart-email-subject-line-example.png)

It goes without saying that your eyes fell on the shorter subject line with 4 words first. With at least 100+ emails bombing into a person's inbox every single day, use this tactic to stand out and get noticed easily.



**_22% of abandoned cart emails have subject lines with 7 words._** 

Right behind the 4-word-subject-lines came in abandoned cart subject lines with 7 words. Here are some of the lines that hit the inbox.

Using the customer name at the start is always a better option because they hardly spend a few seconds to go through the subject lines. 

**_Emojis are used in 4% of the abandoned cart email subject lines._**

Now, that number is very low but that is how it helps. The number of email marketers who use emojis in their subject lines are very few. This means, your subject line catches the eye of the reader instantly when you use one.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/how-to-create-the-perfect-abandoned-cart-email-template-case-study/4-use-of-emoji-in-abandoned-cart-email-subject-line1.png)


Don't just stand there. ‚õµ Your cart!  - which means

Don't just stand there. Sail your cart! or Checkout your cart.

The emoji has been used not just for the sake of it but with the intention of sending out a message via the abandoned cart email subject line.

Here is another example. 

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/how-to-create-the-perfect-abandoned-cart-email-template-case-study/5-use-of-emoji-in-abandoned-cart-email-sublect-line2.png)


You'll thank us later üçª.

**_The subject line 'Did you forget something?' is used by 14% of the abandoned cart emails received._**

It is presumed that customers might have been distracted during the time of checkout leading to a new abandoned cart. Using the subject line 'Did you forget something?' acts as a gentle reminder to get back to the shopping cart. It is definitely not persuasive yet gets the customer thinking about the abandoned cart. 


### Email header

First of all, let's clear the air about what an email header is. Most people tend to confuse them with the subject line. 

Subject line is what is written in the subject of the email whereas the email header is the opening line of the body copy. 


![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/how-to-create-the-perfect-abandoned-cart-email-template-case-study/6-email-header-in-abandoned-cart-email.jpg)


In this abandoned cart email from Fabletics, 'MAKE THEM YOURS' is the email header. The message is loud and clear that a purchase is expected to be made by the email reader or customer. 

Here are the excerpts on reviewing the usage of email headers in the collected abandoned cart emails.  

**_Email headers are used in 70% of the abandoned cart emails._**

Nearly three-fourth of the abandoned cart emails use email headers to get the attention of the customer. The tone of the email headers also matter. Let's classify the email headers. 

**Generic email headers** are found in 36% of abandoned cart emails. They mostly talk about the abandoned cart. 

These are some examples of generic email headers. 



1. Your cart is waiting for you.
2. You left an item in your bag.
3. Forgot something?
4. You left something behind.


![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/how-to-create-the-perfect-abandoned-cart-email-template-case-study/7-generic-email-header-in-abandoned-cart-email.png)


**Innovative email headers** are hard to find and yes, this case study did stumble upon a few of them. 

What difference does an innovative email header make? 

Innovative email header 



*   Projects the brand
*   Creates urgency
*   Addresses insecurities
*   Connects with the respective subject line

Take a look at the abandoned cart email header examples.

Bombas is a brand that sells socks. The brand name becomes synonymous with socks with the use of the email header 'No Bombas Left Behind'.


![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/how-to-create-the-perfect-abandoned-cart-email-template-case-study/8-innovative-email-header-in-abandoned-cart-email-bombas.jpg)


The above email header does the work of reinforcing the brand image of Bombas for socks as well as nudges to make the buy. 

Picky Bars does the email header right by connecting it with the subject line. It is seen as a whole and the subject line is not a stand alone affair. 



![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/how-to-create-the-perfect-abandoned-cart-email-template-case-study/9-innovative-email-header-in-abandoned-cart-email-picky-bars.png)


You literally get the flow when you read it. Whenever you're ready‚Ä¶(No pressure) - We'll keep this right where ya left it. 

That is all about the email headers. 


### Call-To-Action button

Abandoned cart emails without CTA buttons are a complete turn-off. The purpose of the email itself is lost. Take a look at the CTA statistics derived. 

  

**_76% of abandoned cart emails have a single Call-To-Action button._**

Single CTA button does wonders 



*   When the abandoned cart email template is short, devoid of scrolling.
*   When the button is highlighted well, in contrast to the rest of the email.

Here is an example from American Giant.

The bright red color of the CTA button is the only element that strikes the reader just a second into the email. 



![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/how-to-create-the-perfect-abandoned-cart-email-template-case-study/10-CTA-button-in-abandoned-cart-email-example-american-giant.png)


Here is another example of a CTA button where the abandoned cart email is short.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/how-to-create-the-perfect-abandoned-cart-email-template-case-study/11-CTA-button-in-abandoned-cart-email-example-honest-brew.png)


**_20% of email marketers got creative with the CTA copy in abandoned cart emails._**

The copy on a CTA button needs to be effective inorder to retain the customer. Customers are bored of seeing the too common CTA copies like



*   View my cart
*   Return to my cart
*   Complete your purchase
*   Shop now 

80% of abandoned cart emails used CTA copies from the above set. 

How did the rest of 20% write CTA copies then?



*   Lets hit checkout
*   Get in there
*   Have a look
*   Teleport to your cart
*   Apply discount
*   Grab it now
*   Get my barkbox 


### Abandoned Cart Contents

Mention of abandoned products is essential to get the customer back into the buying intent. It should not stop with just reminding the product with the name. A picture of good quality must be presented in the abandoned cart email.

**_80% of the abandoned cart email templates had the product image._**

Most online stores are aware that a product picture can make a difference to the abandoned cart email. The downside is that, usually, the picture is of small size and low resolution. 

This abandoned cart email example from ASOS is the apt one to look up to. 



![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/how-to-create-the-perfect-abandoned-cart-email-template-case-study/12-product-image-in-abandoned-cart-email-example-asos.png)


The picture speaks for itself and that is where the focus lies. Who wouldn't want to buy it?

**_Product testimony or personalized message is added along with the cart content in about 4% of abandoned cart emails._** 

Ghurka does it well this time. You will not take your eyes off the product image.



![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/how-to-create-the-perfect-abandoned-cart-email-template-case-study/Ghurka.jpg)



### Incentives

Customers are always on the lookout for incentives. This is one reason for cart abandonment when they don't find one. It only becomes obvious that incentive is the best way to magnet a customer back. 

**_30% of abandoned cart email templates provide an incentive._**

Incentives come in the form of 



*   Discounts
*   Free shipping
*   Donations for the kind-hearted

Here is an abandoned cart email from Birchbox with a discount of 10%.


![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/how-to-create-the-perfect-abandoned-cart-email-template-case-study/14-incentives-in-abandoned-cart-email-example-birchbox.jpg)



### Social Share button

**_Social share buttons are present in 54% of abandoned cart emails received._**

Social media presence is essential for any eCommerce store in this age of the digital world for better reach. Customer engagement too tends to get purposeful by connecting through social media. 

The link to your stores' social media profiles can be provided at the end of every abandoned cart email. The commonly used social platforms are Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 

More than half of the emails studied have social share buttons. This shows the power of being active in the digital-social world. 

How to depict the social share buttons?

An analysis revealed 2 different ways to depict social share buttons. 

**1. The social logo as such**

Of the 54% of abandoned cart emails with social share buttons, 24% of them did not want to experiment much. The social share logos are present in their original color and form. Here is an example.



![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/how-to-create-the-perfect-abandoned-cart-email-template-case-study/15-social-share-button-in-abandoned-cart-email-example.png)


**2. Modified social share logos**

The rest 30% used social share buttons in a form that merges with the overall email template design. Here is one from Boohoo. 


![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/how-to-create-the-perfect-abandoned-cart-email-template-case-study/16-social-share-button-in-abandoned-cart-email-bohoo.png)


The overall tone of the email is black, including the brand logo. Accordingly, the social share buttons are customized to match the template.  

Here is another abandoned cart email example from Mark Cross.



![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/how-to-create-the-perfect-abandoned-cart-email-template-case-study/17-social-share-button-in-abandoned-cart-email-eample-markcross1.png)


Marine green is the tone of this email. Hence the social share buttons are also kept the same way. This esthetically pleases the senses and maintains uniformity with the overall design of the abandoned cart email template.



![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/how-to-create-the-perfect-abandoned-cart-email-template-case-study/18-social-share-button-in-abandoned-cart-email-example-markcross2.png)
